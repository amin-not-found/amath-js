# amath-js
A simple math library with below features:
- Symbolic computation with support for:
    - polynomials and sin/cos
    - differentiating with respect to a specific variable
    - substituting expressions based on given values 
    - limited simplifying
- Solve multivariate expressions using Newton-Raphson numerical method.

## Todo
- [ ] Abstract away sin and cos to general function derivation
- [ ] Add other functions
- [ ] Add more sophisticated simplification
- [ ] Add a license
